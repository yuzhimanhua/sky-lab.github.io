        The **Scientific Knowledge discoverY (SKY) Lab** at Texas A&M University, directed by Prof. [Yu Zhang](https://yuzhimanhua.github.io), focuses on data mining, natural language processing, and their applications in scientific literature analysis. Our long-term goal is to develop intelligent systems that can process, interpret, and analyze both textual and non-textual scientific data in a more human-like manner, thereby accelerating innovation across scientific disciplines.
